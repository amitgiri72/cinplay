# CinPlay

CinPlay is a web application that serves as an Over-The-Top (OTT) platform, similar to Hotstar, for streaming movies, TV shows, and other video content. It utilizes technologies such as ReactJS, Redux, and Firebase Firestore for data management, and Styled Components for styling.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and securely access their personalized profiles. CinPlay offers login with Google functionality for a convenient and seamless authentication experience.
- **Content Categorization**: The application offers a user-friendly interface for browsing and exploring various categories of content, making it easy for users to discover new movies and shows.
- **Movie Detail Page**: When a user clicks on a movie, CinPlay opens a dedicated movie detail page that provides comprehensive information about the movie, including synopsis, cast, duration, and user reviews.

- **Responsive Design**: CinPlay is designed to be responsive and work seamlessly across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: The application is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: Redux is employed for state management, allowing efficient data flow throughout the application.
- **Firebase Firestore**: CinPlay uses Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database, to store and manage its data, including user profiles, content metadata, and watch history.
